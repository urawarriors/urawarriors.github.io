Mr. Shaw was from a small town, Gilbert LA. He lived in a two-bedroom house with eight brothers and sisters, and his mom and dad. His family was poor. At an early age, he was put to work picking cotton. He knew he was destined for greater things and became one of the first black successful construction companies in Washington, DC.

When she arrived at the hospital distraught and in anguish, the doctor told her they had tried to revive him twice, but he wasn’t responding. Give up, he won’t make it! Bershan told them to try again. The doctor did, he came back and then arrested again. The doctor said he wasn’t responding. Bershan told them to keep going until he gives up. My daddy is a Warrior! Well, they tried five more times. He didn’t have oxygen in his brain for 25 minutes. On the seventh attempt, Mr. Shaw came back. Bershan was told her father would be a vegetable. He would never be able to speak, talk or open his eyes. She didn’t believe it! She said, my daddy, is a warrior. Well, they were wrong. One day later he opened his eyes.
